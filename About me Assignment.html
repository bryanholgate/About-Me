    <h1><img src="Eren Yeagar.jpeg" alt="Header 1 Image" class="header-img">Eren Yeager: Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Eren Yeager. In this page, I hope to introduce to you, the reader, a little about who I am. Yes, I may be a fictional character. But, I hope to give you a little background about who I am and what it is I stood for as well as what was important to me. The following sections will give you a little insight into who I was.</p>

    <h2><img src="Kid Eren.jpeg" alt="Header 2 Image" class="header-img"> Early Life</h2>
    <p>I was born in Shiganshina District on March 30th, 835, in the southern region of Wall Maria to my mom Carla Yeager and my dad Grisha Yeager. I had a few friends, although my best friend was Armin Arlert, whom I often defended from the neighborhood bullies. When I was nine years old I accompanied my father on a house call to the Ackerman family's house only to find both parents murdered and their daughter Mikasa missing. I instead went looking for the murderers and walked in on them trying to take Mikasa. Thinking quickly, I feigned distress and claimed that I was lost. As one of the robbers approached me, I pulled out a hidden knife and stabbed the man. As the second man went after me with an axe, I charged him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, I proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on.</p>

    <h3><img src="eren-yeager-titan-form.avif" alt="Header 3 Image" class="header-img">Abilities</h3>
    <p>Originally, my only noteworthy trait was my natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend my friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As I grew and joined the 104th squad, I trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat. After additional training with Reiner and Annie, my prowess and skill set diversified, including the use of punches, throws, grappling, and submission locks. I had the best scores for hand-to-hand combat of the entire 104th graduate squad. While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave me a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in my own Titan form. After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found me in a refugee camp and brought me into a nearby forest. After giving me the key to the basement, Grisha injected me with a serum, which transformed me into a 4-meter Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a skinny body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving me the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan. In this form, I was a 15-meter tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, my Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making me much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while my intelligence and military training allowed me to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease.</p>

    <h4><img src="mikasa_ackerman___this_world____by_pkblitz_detnxef-fullview.jpg" alt="Header 4 Image" class="header-img"> Relationship: Mikasa Ackerman</h4>
    <p>I had a complex relationship with Mikasa. I often displayed a brusque, casual attitude with her, which belied the deep bond and care we shared. While Mikasa was more open in showing her concern for me, I usually only did so when she was injured or in distress. Despite my blunt exterior, I was always looking out for her, ready to comfort or reassure her when I sensed she needed it. I would even go as far as to call myself a monster just to ensure she wouldn’t be targeted by the prosecution. We didn’t always agree, but I rarely stopped her from doing what she wanted, as long as it was within reason.</p>
    <p>I sometimes harbored an inferiority complex toward Mikasa, feeling overshadowed by her strength and skill in battle. Her habit of constantly trying to keep me out of trouble only made things worse; I found it frustrating, even annoying at times. There were moments when I felt so stifled by her protectiveness that I lashed out, telling her not to treat me like her "little brother." But despite this tension, I would do anything to protect her—even meet a punch from a 14-meter Titan bare-handed if it meant keeping her safe.</p>
    <p>After we crossed the sea, I asked Mikasa what I really meant to her. When she replied that I was “family,” it stung—especially as the moment was interrupted by the arrival of our friends. Eventually, after joining the Yeagerists, I broke all ties with her and the military, and when she tried to bring me back, I lashed out and said things that hurt her deeply. Despite it all, Mikasa stood by me, even willing to support me when Marley launched a counterattack on Paradis after the raid on Liberio, though she left behind the scarf I’d given her years ago.</p>
    <p>When I announced that I’d started the Rumbling, Mikasa was horrified but held onto hope that I might come to my senses. In the Paths, we shared a vision of what life could have been like if we’d run away together for my last four years, a peaceful life I wished we could have shared. I admitted to Armin how much Mikasa meant to me and how deeply I wished she would remember me forever, without loving anyone else. Mikasa continued to mourn me, visiting my grave for decades even as she built a new life. She passed away in old age, still wearing my scarf.</p>
